                            <p class="card-text">This was the thesis in my Master's degree in GIS. In this project, I used MCE methods to detect walkability patterns in Mississauga and Brampton cities.
                             This final map shows areas that are highly attractive for pedestrains and bikers and others that are not. The results were derived based on 6 developed maps:<!--</p>
                            <li>Proximity to destination map</li>
                            <li>Residential density map</li>
                            <li>Commercial density map</li>
                            <li>Walk friendliness map</li>
                            <li>Land-use diversity map</li>
                            <li>Safety map</li>
                            <p class="card-text">Brampton city was found to have the enough potential to develop a walkable city because of the well-connected urban form, unlike Mississauga that is characterized by a sprawling urban form.</p> -->

                                 in the cone of spatial resolution, the results are more accurate which helps the police in the better deployment of patrols across the city.
                                 Their effort will be more focused on roads with a high crime rate instead of safe roads and as a result, this will save money and effort.
